# Hello World

Welcome to the JavaScript Jungle. In this section, we will introduce students to JavaScript in the browser. After a brief overview of JavaScript history, along with introduction to HTML and CSS files, we will introduce the "Periodic Table of JavaScript", a visual diagram that identifies the important parts of the JavaScript language. Students will learn to declare variables using JavaScript primitives, objects, and arrays. After a few brief demos of the various types students will put it all together by incorporating the javascript that makes and HTML form come to life.
