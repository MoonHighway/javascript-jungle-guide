# Review the HTML File

When we review the HTML file, it is important for the students to know that the HTML contains the "nouns" or "things" or "elements" that will be displayed in the browser. On their own, the elements do not do anything, they need JavaScript to make them interactive.

It is also important to discover the Elements Tab in the inspector. The elements tab is a representation of the current state of the Browser. The HTML file was interpreted by the browser, then these "elements" were painted on the screen. This representation is called the DOM or the document object model. As users interact with a web page, the HTML file for that page will not change, but the DOM will change. Objects may be added and removed from here.

- Open and Run the `file://`
