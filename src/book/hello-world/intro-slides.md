# Intro Slides

These slides will be the first thing that students see when you begin the presentation. Use them to introduce what you'll be covering!

Slides can be found in the [student repo](https://github.com/moonhighway/javascript-jungle-student-resources). Run the slides with:

```
npm run intro
```
