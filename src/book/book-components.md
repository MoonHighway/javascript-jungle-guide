# Book Components

This is a style guide for components that will be necessary when constructing any learning materials.

## The Codeblock Component

This component will display codeblocks that are added with codefences in the MDX files. The baseline solution for this would be to have [syntax highlighting](https://mdxjs.com/guides/syntax-highlighting). The extra cool solution would be if these codeblocks were runnable.

A project to review that is similar to what we're looking for is [react-live](https://mdxjs.com/guides/live-code), [react-live docs](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-live), but that is strictly for React components and JSX.

```javascript
function something() {
  console.log("something");
}
```

## Note Component

The note component will be a small "heads-up" component to let the instructor know about something useful in teaching the section.

<Note>
  It's important to pay attention to this before you get
  busy with this section.
</Note>

## Sidebar

A sidebar contains information that relates to the other content. It may provide context or a different approach but the instructor doesn't need to teach that part unless they want to.

<Sidebar>
  <h2>JavaScript History</h2>
  Before there was JavaScript, we used other technologies. They
  were different but not necessarily worse but not necessarily
  better. But probably worse ultimately.
</Sidebar>

## Warning

A warning lets the instructor know about gotchas related to the content. If there's something tricky or has the potential to burn the instructor or students, it belongs in a warning.

<Warning>
  If you don't pay attention to this warning, everything
  will be a difficult struggle.
</Warning>

## Possible Questions

This section would contain a list of questions that students might ask. If there is time to go over them and no students ask them, the answers could be like "Fun Facts" in the section.

<PossibleQuestions>
  <h3>
    Why is JavaScript worse than Java, the language I like?
  </h3>
  <p>They are both good. And both bad.</p>
  <h3>Where can I learn more about JavaScript?</h3>
  <p>In this class! </p>
</PossibleQuestions>

## Definition

This block would define an important term related to the content.

<Definition>
  <dt>Function Composition</dt>
  <dd>
    Combining two or more functions to create a new
    function.
  </dd>
</Definition>

<Definition>
  <dt>Array</dt>
  <dd>
    A list-like object that stores entries as single values
  </dd>
</Definition>

<Definition>
  <dt>Set</dt>
  <dd>
    Set objects are collections of unique values. You can
    iterate through the elements of a set in insertion
    order.
  </dd>
</Definition>
