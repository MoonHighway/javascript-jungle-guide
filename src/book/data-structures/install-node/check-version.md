# Check Version

In this section, we're going to make sure that students have Node.js installed correctly. The students should arrive with this step complete, but this is important just in case they skipped that process.

## Check Node and Node Version

Open the Terminal or Command Prompt and run:

```bash
node -v
```

- If they see a version number, good. They're all set.
- If they don't see a version number, follow the instructions to install.
