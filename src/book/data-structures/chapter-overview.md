# 2. JS Data Structures

What are the building blocks of a JavaScript application? In this section, we'll take a closer look at object and arrays, key types that store data in JavaScript apps. We'll start by installing Node.js, the runtime for JavaScript that allows you to build server-side applications with JavaScript. Then we'll dig into the basics of working with objects and arrays. Finally, we'll put everything in context by discussing what JavaScript runs in which environments.
