# Array Samples Overview

This is a student's second introduction to arrays. They saw small examples earlier, but in this section, we'll dig deeper.

A lot of the techniques taught in this section are not typically used with modern JavaScript. We learned that we can work better with Arrays using immutable techniques. Students need to crawl before they walk. Not only will you find all of the following techniques in legacy code, you will often find this code in compiled javascript, because working with mutable arrays and using for loops is actually faster.
