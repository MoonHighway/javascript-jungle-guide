# Object and Array Lab

In this lab, we'll put our skills to work by loading JSON data.

Open up the slides for the students: [https://slides.com/moonhighway/objects-arrays-lab/](https://slides.com/moonhighway/objects-arrays-lab/)

There are a couple files of note:

- ages.json: Ages of some people to load
- birthdays.json: Birthdays of some people and pets to load.

1. Write a JavaScript file that will check the age of a user and tell them whether they are older or younger than JavaScript.
2. The value of JavaScript will be hardcoded as 25.
3. Write a function that will compare the age of the users' birthdays in `birthdays.json` with JavaScript's birthday (9/1/1995).
