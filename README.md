## Course Description

This 4-hour course is an introduction to JavaScript for software developers. The course gives developers the fundamentals they need to take the next steps with JavaScript frameworks and libraries. There's often a temptation to skip the fundamentals and to jump right into advanced concepts. This course will provide a foundation in four hours and equip engineers with what they need to make a positive impact on JavaScript projects.

## Course Goals

React. Node. Angular. What do these popular technologies have in common? They're all JavaScript. Sometimes learning these technologies can feel overwhelming for developers coming from other language, and that feeling of being overwhelmed often stems from not knowing the fundamentals. This course will officially teach you how to navigate the JavaScript Jungle by learning the building blocks of the language and running them in the various environments where JavaScript is used.

Students taking this course will gain a full understanding of how JavaScript works in the browser and its close relationship with HTML and CSS. They'll learn how to run JavaScript on the server and how frontend and backend environments communicate over HTTP. They'll get practice using developer tools and debugging techniques that are used on projects in the real world.

Students will leave the course ready to take the next steps into the world of frameworks and libraries, armed with an understanding of where JavaScript ends and frameworks begin. We'll introduce everything and give people a starting place so that they can do deep dives on their own as needed.

## Course Sections

The course is broken down into 4 parts: three sections and a longer lab activity.

- Hello World: A look at the building blocks of the JavaScript language and an overview of how JavaScript works in the browser.
- Data Structures: An introduction to Node.js with a deeper dive on JavaScript data structures like objects, arrays, and functions.
- HTTP: An exploration of how servers and clients communicate over HTTP asynchronously.
- Lab Activity: Putting it all together with a lab project to build a web server with Node.js.
