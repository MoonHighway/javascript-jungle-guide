# Object and Array Lab

In this lab, we'll put our skills to work by loading JSON data.

Open the slides for students. Run:

```vi
npm run objects-arrays
```

Then open the slides on localhost:5000.

There are a couple files of note:

- ages.json: Ages of some people to load
- birthdays.json: Birthdays of some people and pets to load.

1. Write a JavaScript file that will check the age of a user and tell them whether they are older or younger than JavaScript.
2. The value of JavaScript will be hardcoded as 25.
3. Write a function that will compare the age of the users' birthdays in `birthdays.json` with JavaScript's birthday (9/1/1995).
