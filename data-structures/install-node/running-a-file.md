# Running a File

Node.js files are just JavaScript files that are run with `node` + the name of the file.

1. Create a file called `playground.js`.
2. Add a console.log message to the file:

```javascript
console.log("This is JavaScript Too");
```

- Open the terminal to run in node:

```vi
node playground.js
```

As the instructor, it's a good idea to run:

```vi
clear; node playground.js
```

This will clear the terminal every time you rerun the process with the Up Arrow key.
