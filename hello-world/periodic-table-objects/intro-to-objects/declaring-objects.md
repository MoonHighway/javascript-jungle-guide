# Declaring Objects

Like arrays, you can use a constructor to create an object.

```javascript
const instrument = new Object();
console.log(instrument);
```

But more than likely, you'll use a set of curly braces when defining an object. Like this instrument...

```javascript
const instrument = {};
console.log(instrument);
```
