# Declaring Arrays

1. Create an empty array with `new Array()`

```javascript
const instruments = new Array();
console.log(instruments);
```

It's highly unlikely that you'll actually use the constructor to create an array. Instead, you'll probably use brackets.

2. Create an empty array with `[]`

```javascript
const instruments = [];
console.log(instruments);
```
