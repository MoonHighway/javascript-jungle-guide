# Pushing and Popping with Arrays

Just like strings have built-in properties and methods that you can access so do arrays!

To add an item to an array, use `.push()`.

```javascript
instruments.push("harp");
console.log(instruments);
```

To remove the last item from an array, use `.pop()`.

```javascript
instruments.pop();
console.log(instruments);
```

<Warning>
Both of these methods will mutate or change the original array. Use with caution!
