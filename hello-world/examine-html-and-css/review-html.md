# Review the HTML File

When we review the HTML file, it is important that students know:

- The HTML contains the "nouns" or "things" or "elements" that will be displayed in the browser
- The elements do not do anything, they need JavaScript to make them interactive.

## Things to Show

- Show the Start Folder
- Open and Run the `file://`
- Show the file being displayed
- Show the View -> Source
- Then Right Click and show `Inspect`
- Then Cover the HTML File
  - Header
  - Main
  - Form Elements
  - They can hold values, but doesn't change the DOM
  - Button
- DOM Changes
  - Remove a couple of objects
  - you changed the DOM
  - Refresh the page. The original elements are loaded again from HTML
