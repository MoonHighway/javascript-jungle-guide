# Review CSS

- Go to the source and add the CSS Link: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="" type="text/css" />`
  - You can do this with the students
- From the elements panel show the Styles panel
  - Select an element and change its style
  - Describe the styles component
  - Refresh the page to show that the original CSS has not changed, it can be reloaded
  - You changed the CSS in the DOM
- Quickly Show CSS (CSS Describes how element looks)
  - SELECTOR: How elements are selected in CSS
  - STYLES: Each elements style properties
- CSS is a whole other thing, and this isn't a CSS class, but you need to know some CSS basics when working in the browser.
