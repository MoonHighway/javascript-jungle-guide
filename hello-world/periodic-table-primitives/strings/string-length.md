# String Length

JavaScript strings have built-in functions and methods that can be used for a variety of purposes. Use `.length` to find a string's length.

```javascript
let message = `${name} is ${age * 7}`;

console.log(message.length);
console.log("Hello World".length);
```

<Error>
If you're seeing the error "message.length is not a function", make sure you're using the property (.length) not a method .length().
</Error>
