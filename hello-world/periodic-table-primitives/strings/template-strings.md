# Template Strings

1. Convert a regular string to a template string

Maybe the best way to create a string is to use a template string. They allow you to inject variables and add functions within strings.

```javascript
console.log("Biscuit is 70");
```

<Info>
Use the backtick character. It's not a single quote. Find the backtick in the upper left corner of your keyboard beneath the escape key.
</Info>

```javascript
console.log(`${name} is ${age * 7}`);
```

2. Change the variables and see the output change!

```javascript
let age = 43;
let name = "Alex";
```
