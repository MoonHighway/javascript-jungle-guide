# Concatenation

(1) Concatenate a Number

```javascript
console.log(typeof name);
console.log(name + " is " + age);
```

(2) Adding with strings is always concatenation

```javascript
console.log(name + " is " + age + age);
```

(3) Use parenthesis to help JavaScript with Order of operations

```javascript
console.log(name + " is " + (age + age));
```

(4) Don't need for multiply because you can't multiply strings.

```javascript
console.log(name + " is " + age * 7);
```
