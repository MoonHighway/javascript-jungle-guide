# If Else Statements

Now let's create a boolean called `isAnything` and test for whether it is true or false.

```javascript
let isAnything = true;
console.log(typeof isAnything);
console.log(isAnything);

if (isAnything) {
  console.log("It's something");
} else {
  console.log("It's nothing");
}
```
