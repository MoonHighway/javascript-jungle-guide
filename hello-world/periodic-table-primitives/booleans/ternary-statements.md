# Ternary If Statements

It's sometimes useful to write an if/else statement with a shorter syntax. You can actually write this in a single line.

You can read this as:

1. Is `isAnything` true?
2. If so, return "It's something".
3. If not, return "It's nothing".

```javascript
console.log(isAnything ? "It's something" : "It's nothing");
```
