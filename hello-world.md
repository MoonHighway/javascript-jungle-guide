# Hello World

In this section, your job is to introduce JavaScript and review the building blocks of the JavaScript language and how JavaScript works in the browser. It's likely that your students will have a range of experience in this class: some know a bit of JavaScript, some know nothing, some pretend to know more than they know. Don't rush through the content.

## Learning Goals

Students leaving this class section will be able to confidently create and run JavaScript programs using Node.js. They will understand how to work with arrays and objects at a basic level. They will also understand the differences between JavaScript files that run in a browser vs. a server.
