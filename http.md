# HTTP

In this section, we'll explore how servers and clients communicate over HTTP asynchronously.

## Topics Covered

- HTTP Overview Slides
- Asynchronous JavaScript
- Serving a Website

## Learning Goals

In this section, we want students to get hands-on experience and understanding of how to work with JavaScript asynchronously. This will include everything from callbacks to async/await to fetch to timers to generators. Think of this section as being a section that some people think they know but you will introduce them to a bunch of great new techniques for managing asynchronous data.
