# Lab: Mood Server

Let everyone put their new skills to use! In this lab, we'll use JavaScript on the client and the server to create an application that serves an HTML file dynamically, depending on the variable being passed to the node app in the command line.

## Steps

- Serve an HTML File
- Serve an Image (binary file)
- Create a Variable
- Incorporate the `readline` package
- Change the mood via readline
- Quit from the readline
