## 3. HTTP

It's one thing to have data stored in a local array or object, but the power of JavaScript starts to reveal itself when you start fetching data. In this section, we'll start with an overview of HTTP methods. Then we'll learn about more advanced patterns with functions like default arguments, destructuring assignment, and arrow functions. We'll get into synchronous vs. asynchronous data, and we'll build an HTTP server that serves HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Finally, we'll fetch some remote data with a form.
